This folder contains files related to the Hyper-U-Net model
First, need to install the required libraries which are mentioned in the file “requirements”
This model was trained using tensorflow/keras
For training, user can compile the file “train_Hyper_U_NET” for the HyperUNet model, or “train_U_Net.py” for the UNet model
For prediction, user can use “predict_test_50_images.py” to predict the 50 testing images located inside the folder “test_50images”, for historical images prediction, the file “predict_histo_images.py” can be used. 
Because of issue of disk-space, the training data and the trained model are uploaded separately
The link to training data is:
